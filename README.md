# PyRegexBuilder

> Build regular expressions swiftly in Python.

PyRegexBuilder allows you to build regular expressions using a DSL similar to that of [Swift RegexBuilder](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/regexbuilder). It uses the stdlib-compatible [regex](https://github.com/mrabarnett/mrab-regex) module.

## Features to implement

- [ ] Scoped and global flags
- [ ] Character classes and set operations
