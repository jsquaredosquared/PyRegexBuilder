# PyRegexBuilder

> Build regular expressions swiftly in Python.

- PyRegexBuilder allows you to build regular expressions using a DSL similar to that of [Swift RegexBuilder](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/regexbuilder).
- PyRegexBuilder is powered by the [regex](https://github.com/mrabarnett/mrab-regex) module.

## Usage

## Roadmap
